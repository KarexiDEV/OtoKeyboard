SECURITY NOTE (Please Read)
================================================

Hello!

When you try to run the program (.exe file), Windows may show you a security warning (SmartScreen or UAC) stating "Unknown Publisher" or "Windows protected your PC".

THIS IS NOT AN ERROR.

This warning appears because the program is made by an independent developer and does not yet have a digital code signing certificate.

Our program will be signed soon, and this warning will be removed in future versions.

The current version of the program is safe and does not contain any malware.

To bypass the warning and launch the program:
1. On the blue warning screen, click on "More info".
2. A "Run anyway" button will appear. Click this button.

The program will then start safely.

If you have any questions or issues, you can contact our support team:

Thank you for your understanding and support,
